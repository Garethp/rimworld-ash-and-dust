We therefore commit this body to the ground, earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust.
		
Each and every colonist deserves a burial suited to their religion. If your colony believes that nature is most sacred, it doesn't make any sense to put the remains of your people in a stone coffin unable to return back into the earth. This mod aims to solve that by adding several new funeral types for your ideoligions:
		
 1. Natural Burials - Return your bodies to the earth and let their spirits come back as trees to guide your colonists onwards
 2. Heroic Burials - Show your colonists the proper respect they deserve. The richer your colony, the higher the expectation your colonists will have of how extravagent their burial chambers should be
 3. Cannibal Burials - Flesh in the ground is flesh wasted. We partake in the flesh of our fallen so that we may bring their spirits into our own. In this way we are never truly separated from the departed
 4. Pirate Burials - We have no time to dock this ship and hold a land funeral! Throw them in a casket overboard and we'll drink to their memory instead
 5. Ceremonial Cremation - Our dear raiders will live on in the heavens, so we commit their bodies to ash so as not to be chained to this planet anymore
		
As of now, only Ceremonail Cremations are still unfinished.
