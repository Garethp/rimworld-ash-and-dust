## Ideas

#### General
 * If a ceremony is desired by is unable to be performed due to a loss of body, harsher negative and no "missing body" ceremony

#### Tree Burial
 * Memes:
   * Tree Connection
   * Nature Supremacy
 * Trees/plants that can spawn will depend on the quality of the ritual
 * Will always spawn **something**, no matter how bad the quality
 * Can only happen at the new graves
   * Can only be placed where trees can grow?
 * Regular Outcomes
   * Normal Tree
   * Patch of flowers
 * Good outcomes
   * Patch of ambrosia
   * Anima tree without building limits
 * Ancestor Trees
   * Will be a meditation focus
   * Allows buildings near by
   * Provides learning based on the colonists best stats
 * Styles
   * Morbid - Skulls on the tree base, maybe some red stains
   * Normal - Tanabata decorations?
   * Animist - ???
   * Techist - ???  

#### Honoured Burial
 * Memes:
   * Supremacist
   * Human Primacy
   * Any?
 * Conflicting Memes:
   * Collectivist
   * Guilty
 * Adds burial requirements to be honourable
   * Room quality dependant on colony expectations
   * Casket value dependant on expectations
   * Maybe there should be a statue at the top for higher tiers of expectations
   * Leaders should not share room with other non-leaders?
 * Burial chambers can be meditation spot
   * Maybe a skill gain similar to the tree burial
   * Or maybe a small buff for meditating there that day

#### Cremation
 * All colonists must be cremated
 * Get an urn out of it?

#### Sky Burial
 * Like Cremation
 * Small buff for raiders?

#### Cannibal
 * Memes:
   * Cannibal
 * All colonists should be eaten
   * People who are close relations can absorb some of their knowledge
